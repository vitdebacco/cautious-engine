A work in progress comparison of web frameworks for Kotlin & Go microservices.

The intent of this project is to provide a relative comparison of the
performance of basic microservices built using different technologies. It is 
meant to be an expanded take on [Practical Performance Comparison of Spring Boot, 
Micronaut 1.3, Micronaut 2.0](https://micronaut.io/blog/2020-04-28-performance-comparison-spring-boot-micronaut.html)

### WIP: Short Term vs. Long Term
- The initial goal of the project is to support a generic GET endpoint that 
returns random data generated by Faker.
- Expand to support CRUD operations backed by a Postgres datastore. The goal 
will be to compare performance of a more realistic service, as well as sense 
of how Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot with jOOQ, Micronaut Data JPA, and several 
other webframeworks using Exposed ORM stack up in a relative sense. This 
could be expanded to include other ORM/persistence frameworks.

### Curent Implementations 
#### Random Address Data
- Spring Boot 2.x
- Micronaut 2.x
- Quarkus
- Ktor
- http4k
- Kooby/Jooby for Kotlin
- Javalin

### Considerations for Future Additions
Longer term thoughts for additions. 
- Jetty vs Netty vs Tomcat vs ?
- JVM comparisons (AdoptOpenJDK, Corretto, GraalVM, etc)
- Jackson vs. GSON vs. kotlinx.serialization vs ?
- Dependency Injection alternatives
- other languages? (Rust, etc)

### Running the Project
- nav to the root of the preferred project
- follow each build & run instructions as outlined in the project's README.md 
- in another terminal tab or window, nav to the `load-tests`
- start the simulation: `./gradlew gatlingRun --rerun-tasks`. See project
  readme for additional options.
